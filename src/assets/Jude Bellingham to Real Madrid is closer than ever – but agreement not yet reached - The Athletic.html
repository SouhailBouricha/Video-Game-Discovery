According to Madrid sources — who, like all those cited in this story, preferred to remain anonymous when speaking with The Athletic in order to protect their positions — Bellingham has said he would be excited to join and that he loves the project being prepared for him. Advertisement Madrid want him to become a key part of their next generation, the one that will inaugurate the newly-rebuilt Santiago Bernabeu. However, The Athletic is not clear whether this means Madrid have concluded a definitive agreement with the midfielder, as has been reported elsewhere. Multiple sources with knowledge of the situation would not be drawn on the matter. And on Wednesday, Madrid sources denied to The Athletic that an agreement or even an agreement in principle with  has been reached. Other sources close to the subject said the clubs have not yet entered into decisive talks over a fee. Madrid sources have always spoken about any potential transfer in cautious terms, and as we will see, there are several reasons for that. They have long considered themselves in a disadvantaged position compared to  and , who have also shown strong interest in signing Bellingham, although the Merseyside club dropped out of the running last month. The Spanish champions do not believe they can offer him as much money as City, and their valuation of the player is lower than Dortmund’s asking price of €150million (£131.8m; $165.6m). As previously reported by The Athletic, their valuation is closer to around €100m. Madrid are continuing with caution, but movement in recent weeks, including talks with the 19-year-old England international, means they now feel more optimistic. Will Jude Bellingham end up playing for Real Madrid? Right now it seems the most likely option, but it is not certain. Sources point to the example of how Madrid signed  from AS Monaco last summer. They say that Bellingham’s arrival would have to follow the same sequence of events: the player would have to choose Madrid, where he would earn less money, and the selling club would have to accept a lower offer than the one English clubs might be able to put together. Advertisement In this sense, the variables will be key — as they were a year ago with Tchouameni. The deal Madrid agreed with Monaco for the Frenchman was closed at €80million plus €20m in variables, €10m of which were very likely to be activated. Club sources indicate they are willing to make an effort for Bellingham, but always explain their thinking with the caveat that they have no plans to do anything “crazy”, or enter into an auction with  rivals who can afford to spend more. In this scenario, the excellent relations between Madrid and Dortmund could help — but both are aware that this is business and each club only defends their own interests. Madrid are also aware that, if Dortmund were to decide against selling this summer, they would be in a weaker negotiating position next year, with Bellingham’s current contract due to expire in June 2025.\n\nBellingham, playing for Dortmund on April 22 (Photo by Joachim Bywaletz/DeFodi Images via Getty Images) “It is usual for the media to be ahead of reality, as happened with [Kylian] Mbappe, but we have to keep working,” a Real Madrid source told The Athletic on Wednesday. Why did they say this? Because Spanish sports daily Marca had published a news article reporting that Madrid had agreed almost everything required for the transfer to go ahead, both with Dortmund and the player. But hours later — and on their front page — Marca amended the story to report Real had come to an agreement with Bellingham only. Something similar happened with the other major Madrid-based sports newspaper, Diario AS. On Wednesday afternoon, a news article was published that spoke of an “agreement in principle” with Bellingham. Later that day, the story was replaced with a new article titled: “Madrid deny agreement”. “From Madrid, they consider that Dortmund will sell the player to the highest bidder, as they did with [Erling] Haaland, and in that context, they do not see the operation as entirely feasible,” read the first paragraph. Advertisement At Madrid’s training ground, the soap opera is being followed with great interest. Developments have also been met with some surprise in the dressing room. has already signed for one more year (Madrid were open to offering him an extension for two seasons) and club president Florentino Perez told  in a meeting in March that he wants the Croatian playmaker to renew his contract. With  — whose contract is also up in the summer — the situation is not as clear, but even if he doesn’t stay, Madrid will still have Kroos and Modric. Both are players who Ancelotti adores and finds difficult to bench, despite Perez’s preference for the Italian to field younger players. Bellingham would also face competition for a starting spot from  — one of Madrid’s pillars in recent seasons — as well as , who is in talks to renew his contract and who Perez wants to be played more as a midfielder than a left-back, plus Tchouameni, who has seen first-team opportunities limited. Madrid’s coaching staff don’t know much about the situation regarding Bellingham. The club’s sporting leadership only consults with them on specific points from time to time. The management team are only focused on saving their jobs, with crucial fixtures coming up. Real play the Copa del Rey final against  on Saturday and the first leg of the  semi-final tie against City on Tuesday. After what happened with Mbappe — whose signing was prematurely taken for granted by Madrid last summer, with details leaked to the media — the club prefers to be cautious over Bellingham’s potential arrival. Good work has been done, but there is still some way to go.

Other sources close to the subject said the clubs have not yet entered into decisive talks over a fee.</p><p>Madrid sources have always spoken about any potential transfer in cautious terms, and as we will see, there are several reasons for that.</p><p>They have long considered themselves in a disadvantaged position compared to <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/team/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> and <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/team/manchester-city/">Manchester City</a>, who have also shown strong interest in signing Bellingham, although the Merseyside club dropped out of the running last month.</p><a href="https://theathletic.com/4402540/2023/04/11/liverpool-jude-bellingham-transfer-latest/" class="go-deeper"><div class="go-deeper"><div class="go-deeper-img"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,height=128,fit=cover,format=auto/app/uploads/2023/04/11161440/GettyImages-1437542323-scaled-e1681244117207-1024x683.jpg" class="go-deeper" alt="go-deeper"></div><div><p class="go-deeper-label">GO DEEPER</p><p class="go-deeper-title">Liverpool pull out of race to sign Jude Bellingham</p></div></div></a><p>The Spanish champions do not believe they can offer him as much money as City, and their valuation of the player is lower than Dortmund’s asking price of €150million (£131.8m; $165.6m). As previously reported by <em>The Athletic,</em> their valuation is closer to around €100m.</p><p>Madrid are continuing with caution, but movement in recent weeks, including talks with the 19-year-old England international, means they now feel more optimistic.</p><p>Will Jude Bellingham end up playing for Real Madrid? Right now it seems the most likely option, but it is not certain.</p><p>Sources point to the example of how Madrid signed <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/aurelien-tchouameni-3s27o6UtUPTcnWv5/">Aurelien Tchouameni</a> from AS Monaco last summer. They say that Bellingham’s arrival would have to follow the same sequence of events: the player would have to choose Madrid, where he would earn less money, and the selling club would have to accept a lower offer than the one English clubs might be able to put together.</p><div class="ad-container"><div class="ad-wrapper article-treatment"><div class=ad-slug-container><p class="ad-slug">Advertisement</p></div><div id="mid2" data-position="mid2" class="ad place-ad"></div></div></div><p>In this sense, the variables will be key — as they were a year ago with Tchouameni. The deal Madrid agreed with Monaco for the Frenchman was closed at €80million plus €20m in variables, €10m of which were very likely to be activated.</p><p>Club sources indicate they are willing to make an effort for Bellingham, but always explain their thinking with the caveat that they have no plans to do anything “crazy”, or enter into an auction with <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/premier-league/">Premier League</a> rivals who can afford to spend more.</p><p>In this scenario, the excellent relations between Madrid and Dortmund could help — but both are aware that this is business and each club only defends their own interests. Madrid are also aware that, if Dortmund were to decide against selling this summer, they would be in a weaker negotiating position next year, with Bellingham’s current contract due to expire in June 2025.</p><div id="attachment_4487904" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><div class="wp-caption-image-container"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4487904 size-full" src="https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/04074805/GettyImages-1252106271-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/04074805/GettyImages-1252106271-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/04074805/GettyImages-1252106271-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/04074805/GettyImages-1252106271-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/04074805/GettyImages-1252106271-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/04074805/GettyImages-1252106271-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"><div class="inline-credits"><div class="inline-credits-container">

Something similar happened with the other major Madrid-based sports newspaper, Diario AS.</p><a href="https://theathletic.com/4356074/2023/03/29/jude-bellingham-transfer-manchester-city/" class="go-deeper"><div class="go-deeper"><div class="go-deeper-img"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,height=128,fit=cover,format=auto/app/uploads/2023/03/28092957/GettyImages-1472845875-1024x683.jpg" class="go-deeper" alt="go-deeper"></div><div><p class="go-deeper-label">GO DEEPER</p><p class="go-deeper-title">Bellingham to Man City sounds good - whether it makes sense is another matter</p></div></div></a><p>On Wednesday afternoon, a news article was published that spoke of an “agreement in principle” with Bellingham. Later that day, the story was replaced with a new article titled: “Madrid deny agreement”.</p><p>“From Madrid, they consider that Dortmund will sell the player to the highest bidder, as they did with [Erling] Haaland, and in that context, they do not see the operation as entirely feasible,” read the first paragraph.</p><div class="ad-container"><div class="ad-wrapper article-treatment"><div class=ad-slug-container><p class="ad-slug">Advertisement</p></div><div id="mid3" data-position="mid3" class="ad place-ad"></div></div></div><p>At Madrid’s training ground, the soap opera is being followed with great interest. Developments have also been met with some surprise in the dressing room.</p><p><a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/toni-kroos-VNHrYFlFiWQi2LXH/">Toni Kroos</a> has already signed for one more year (Madrid were open to offering him an extension for two seasons) and club president Florentino Perez told <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/luka-modric-X2pcWLKRmvOngwFC/">Luka Modric</a> in a meeting in March that he wants the Croatian playmaker to renew his contract.</p><p>With <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/dani-ceballos-GD8WHXteo7Ll3u2q/">Dani Ceballos</a> — whose contract is also up in the summer — the situation is not as clear, but even if he doesn’t stay, Madrid will still have Kroos and Modric. Both are players who Ancelotti adores and finds difficult to bench, despite Perez’s preference for the Italian to field younger players.</p><p>Bellingham would also face competition for a starting spot from <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/federico-valverde-7xkBDGz7u8vo68xZ/">Federico Valverde</a> — one of Madrid’s pillars in recent seasons — as well as <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/player/eduardo-camavinga-qBwUXaLK9rZqTwy4/">Eduardo Camavinga</a>, who is in talks to renew his contract and who Perez wants to be played more as a midfielder than a left-back, plus Tchouameni, who has seen first-team opportunities limited.</p><p>Madrid’s coaching staff don’t know much about the situation regarding Bellingham. The club’s sporting leadership only consults with them on specific points from time to time. The management team are only focused on saving their jobs, with crucial fixtures coming up. Real play the Copa del Rey final against <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/team/ca-osasuna/">Osasuna</a> on Saturday and the first leg of the <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://theathletic.com/football/champions-league/">Champions League</a> semi-final tie against City on Tuesday.</p><p>After what happened with Mbappe — whose signing was prematurely taken for granted by Madrid last summer, with details leaked to the media — the club prefers to be cautious over Bellingham’s potential arrival.</p><p>Good work has been done, but there is still some way to go.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>(Top photo: Mika Volkmann/Getty Images)</em></p>

As previously reported by \u003cem\u003eThe Athletic,\u003c/em\u003e their valuation is closer to around €100m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadrid are continuing with caution, but movement in recent weeks, including talks with the 19-year-old England international, means they now feel more optimistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill Jude Bellingham end up playing for Real Madrid?
